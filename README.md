# Social Network Analysis Experiments (17MCPC14)

This project contains set of algorithms, examples written to try different approaches to social networking analysis. Most of the code is written using NetworkX python package.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to execute the sample:

git clone https://github.com/17mcpc14/sna.git

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3
```
These exples need a minimum version of Python3 as these leverage the object oriented python implementation


```
NetworkX, Matplot, Numpy, Scipy
```
Apart from Python3, the example use NetworkX, Numpy, Scipy and Matplot libraries for network analysis, computation and plotting purposes.


### Installation using Anaconda package manager

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

If you choose to automatically install Python3 and other required libraries using Anaconda or Miniconda, please follow the instruction for corresponding environment setup at https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html


```
Running program - Spectral decomposition algorithm for small (34 nodes) Karate Club network
```

1. Open Spyder
2. Open spectral.py
3. Hit run


```
Running program - Spectral decomposition, K-Means algorithm for medium size (1000 nodes) power law cluster graph 
```

1. Open Spyder
2. Open spectral_medium.py
3. Hit run

## Running the programs command like

To execute Spectral decomposition on a small (34 nodes) Karate Club network

1. Run command `python3 spectral.py'

To execute Spectral decomposition, K-Means  on a medium (1000 nodes) power law cluster graph
 
2. Run command `python3 spectral_medium.py`
